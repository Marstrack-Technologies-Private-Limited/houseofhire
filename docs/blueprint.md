- Primary color: Navy blue (#1E3A8A) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F9FAFB) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#34D399) to highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headlines and body text; a modern, neutral look is desired.
- Implement a responsive layout with a two-column dashboard on desktop and a single-column layout on mobile devices.
- Use a consistent set of icons from a library like Feather or Heroicons for common actions and navigation. All icons will match the color of the body text.
- Employ subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as button presses and form submissions. Avoid excessive animations that may distract the user.
